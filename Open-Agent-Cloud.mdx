1) Upload a loom video to generate a no-code drag-drop agent in seconds to automate your process directly on our cloud servers.
This is now the fastest way to build agents on the planet! We built a twitter agent that previously took 20 minutes in 5 seconds from a recorded video.
2) Instantly run the agent in Open Agent Cloud and easily scale the same schedule to thousands of agents in parallel all streaming to our dashboard.
Update automatically to the latest version of Open Agent Studio on refresh in 10 seconds without installing anything locally!
3) Tackles the largest unsolved problem in every large enterprise and government with loss of expertise when employees and contractors leave.
You can go back decades and upload videos to generate agents to regain lost expertise with any screen recorded videos.
