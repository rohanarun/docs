### Key Features

Open Agent Studio offers a comprehensive suite of features to empower anyone, regardless of their technical skills, to build powerful RPAs.

#### 1.1 Semantic Targeting

- Define actions and targets using plain English commands.
- Eliminate the need for complex code selectors.
- **Examples**:
    - "Click the button labeled 'Login'"
    - "Extract the text from the table header" 
    - "Enter '{{my_variable}}' into the search field"

#### 1.2 Node-Based Visual Workflow

- Build automations through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
- Utilize various node types representing distinct actions like clicks, keypresses, data extraction, data processing, and web interactions.
- Connect nodes to define the flow and logic of your automation.

#### 1.3 LLMs for Enhanced Understanding

- Understand your semantic targets and translate them into specific actions.
- Dynamically adapt to website changes.
- Automate tasks on websites without building custom selectors for each element.

#### 1.4 Variables and Data Management

- Define variables to store data and dynamically use it throughout your automation.
- Manage data from various sources, including web scraping, files (PDF, Docx, CSV, Excel), and API calls.

#### 1.5 Scheduling and Triggers

- Schedule your agents to run automatically at specific times or intervals using a visual cron scheduler.
- Trigger agents based on:
    - Scheduled events (specific times, intervals)
    - Emails (specific content, sender)
    - Webhooks (external triggers from other applications)
    - SMS messages (specific content, sender)
    - Phone calls (initiate automations based on voice prompts)
    - Semantic Triggers (initiate automations based on specific screen states)

#### 1.6 Agent Sharing and Community

- Upload your completed agents to the Cheat Layer community to share with others.
- Access a library of pre-built agents for various tasks, saving you development time.

### Advanced Features

Open Agent Studio provides a number of advanced features for building sophisticated and robust automations.

#### 2.1 Looping

- Implement looping mechanisms to iteratively execute actions on multiple targets. 
- **Loop Total Runs**: Executes a section of the workflow a predetermined number of times.
- **Loop Node Runs**: Executes a section of the workflow based on the number of times a specific node has executed. 
    - Useful for processing lists of data, scraping multiple pages on a website, or sending out batch emails.

#### 2.2 Conditional Logic

- Use "If Else" nodes to create branching paths in your automation based on specific conditions.
- Conditions can be based on:
    - Variable values
    - Comparisons (equals, greater than, less than)
    - Regular expressions
- This enables dynamic execution of actions based on data or website state changes.

#### 2.3 Python Integration

- Embed custom Python code blocks within your automation using the "Python Code" node.
- Access Open Agent Studio's API through the provided `thread_signals` object within your code to:
    - Send notifications (`thread_signals.notifications.emit`)
    - Trigger internal actions (`thread_signals.chat.emit`)
    - Interact with global variables (`graph.global_variables`)
- This allows you to:
    - Implement complex logic not possible with pre-built nodes
    - Integrate with external libraries and services
    - Perform advanced data manipulations

#### 2.4 Web Scraping with "Magic Scraper"

Efficiently extract data from websites using various "Magic Scraper" configurations.

**Options**:

- Target specific HTML elements (links, images, text)
- Filter based on text content and attributes
- Handle dynamic content
- Use variables to dynamically define targets

**Extracted data can be**:

- Stored in variables
- Used for further processing within the automation
- Exported to external services like Google Sheets

#### 2.5 Semantic Element Detection

Combine "SemanticDescribe" and "Click" nodes for robust element interaction.

- "SemanticDescribe" captures a target based on your description, even if its visual appearance changes.
- "Click" then uses the captured target for precise interaction.
- This method improves automation resilience against website design updates.

#### 2.6 Data Processing with GPT-4

Leverage GPT-4's capabilities to:

- Summarize large amounts of text
- Analyze and extract insights from data
- Translate languages
- Generate text content
- Build conversational agents

Use variables to pass data between nodes and GPT-4 prompts.

#### 2.7 API Integrations

Connect with external platforms and services through API calls using the "Send Data" and "Python Code" nodes.

Automate processes involving:
- Data Retrieval
- Workflow Triggering
- Real-time Data Exchange

#### 2.8 Agent Management

Easily manage your agents through the intuitive interface.

**Features**:
- Create, edit, and delete agents.
- Save and open automation files (.cheat).
- Version control for tracking changes.
- Duplicate existing agents for quick customization.

#### 2.9 Global Variables

- Utilize global variables to store data and share it across different nodes within your automation.
- Access variables through the dropdown menus in node properties.
- Update variable values dynamically during automation execution.
