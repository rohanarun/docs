## Open Agent Studio: No-Code RPA Platform Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for **Open Agent Studio**, a revolutionary no-code platform for building Robotic Process Automation (RPA) agents. 

**Download Compiled Executables Or Run In Open Agent Cloud**: https://cheatlayer.com



### Introduction

Open Agent Studio is the first cross platform desktop application built to enable Agentic Process Automation as an open-source alternative and replacement for UIpath and all other RPA tools today.

We founded Cheat Layer during the pandemic to help people who had lost their jobs and businesses rebuild online using GPT-3. We personally helped hundreds pro bono before turning to AI for help.

In August 2021, we were the first startup to get approved by openAI to sell GPT-3 for automation. We were the first to publish our framework for agents, Project Atlas, in July 2022.

Businesses today are threatening to fire employees and replace them with AI. We believe within 2 years, the AI necessary to generate most of those businesses will be a commodity.

In a future where the AI in your pocket can generate custom, secure, and free versions of all the most expensive business software, we believe there'll be a level playing field that removes the barrier to build these businesses. More small businesses will build competitive brands through personal relationships, better quality service, and network effects through unique data. We invite you to join us in building this future together faster.

This is an older public version of our internal private repo which will be updated in the coming days with the latest updates to Open Agent Studio 7.0.0 which can be downloaded at openagent.studio now.
